# Argent Account on StarkNet

*Warning: StarkNet is still in alpha, so is this project. In particular the `ArgentAccount.cairo` contract has not been audited yet and should not be used to store significant value.*

## High-Level Specification

The account is a 2-of-2 custom multisig where the `signer` key is typically stored on the user's phone and the `guardian` key is managed by an off-chain service to enable fraud monitoring (e.g. trusted contacts, daily limits, etc) and recovery. More specifically, the `guardian` acts both as a co-validator for typical operations of the wallet, and as the trusted actor that can recover the wallet in case the `signer` key is lost or compromised.

The user can always opt-out of the guardian service and manage the guardian key himself. Alternatively he/she can add a second `guardian_backup` key to the account that has the same role as the `guardian` and can be used as the ultimate censorship resistance guarantee.

Normal operations of the wallet (`execute`, `change_signer`, `change_guardian`, `change_guardian_backup`, `validate_guardian_signature`, `cancel_escape`) require the approval of both parties to be executed.

Each party alone can trigger the `escape` mode (a.k.a. recovery) on the wallet if the other party is not cooperating or lost. An escape takes 7 days before being active, after which the non-cooperating party can be replaced.
The wallet is asymmetric in favor of the `signer` who can override an escape triggered by the guardian.

A triggered escape can always be cancelled with the approval of both parties.

We assume that the `signer` key is backed up such that the probability of the `signer` key being lost should be close to zero.

Under this model we can build a simple yet highly secure non-custodial wallet.

To enable that model to evolve if needed, the account is implemented as a proxy delegating all calls to a target implementation. Upgrading the wallet to a new implementation requires the approval of both the `signer` and a `guardian`.
